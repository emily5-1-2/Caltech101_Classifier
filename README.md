# Caltech101_Classifier

This is a classifier for the Caltech101 image dataset. The model makes use of image embeddings obtained from CLIP, which are then input into a two-layer MLP for classification. The PyTorch Lightning framework was used.

Simple experiments for changing hyperparameters were done. The results are shown in the following links:
